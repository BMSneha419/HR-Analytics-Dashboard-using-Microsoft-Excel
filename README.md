# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-using-Microsoft-Excel

# Project Overview
This project is an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard created in Microsoft Excel. It provides a comprehensive, data-driven view of a company's workforce. The dashboard's primary focus is on analyzing employee attrition, using key performance indicators (KPIs) and dynamic visualizations to empower HR professionals and business leaders with actionable insights. The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle.

# Insights Gained
## KPIs
1. **Total Headcount: 50,000 employees**  
 The company has a large and diverse workforce of **50,000 employees**. This number is a baseline for all other metrics and is crucial for high-level workforce planning.
2. **Attrition Rate: 33%**  
 An attrition rate of **33%** is extremely high. This indicates that one-third of the workforce is leaving the company, suggesting a significant problem with employee retention, morale, or compensation.
3. **Average Performance Rating: 2.997**  
 An average rating of 2.997 is slightly below the midpoint. This indicates that the average employee performance is not high, and there may be a need for improved training, development programs, or more effective performance management.
4. **Average Employee Tenure: 4.04 years**  
 The average employee stays with the company for just over **four years**. This is a crucial number for succession planning and understanding if you are retaining institutional knowledge.
5. **Average Salary: Rs.75,090**  
 This is the average annual salary across the entire company. This metric is a benchmark for compensation and can be used to compare pay levels across departments or with industry standards.
6. **Total Training Hours: 2,505,045 hours**  
 This number represents a significant investment in employee development. However, the low average performance rating suggests that this investment may not be leading to a tangible improvement in performance.

## Charts
1. **Employee Headcount by Department**    
 The Finance department is the largest with **10,097 employees**, while the IT department is the smallest at **9,932 employees**. This indicates a relatively even distribution of employees across the major departments.
2. **Average Performance Rating by Department**  
 All departments have a remarkably consistent average performance rating around **2.997**. This suggests that while no single department is performing significantly better or worse than the others, there is a company-wide opportunity to improve overall performance.
3. **Workforce Distribution by Age Group**  
 The company has a significant concentration of employees in the **>55 age group** with **11,965 employees**. This indicates an aging workforce with a substantial number of employees approaching retirement.
4. **Average Salary by Job Category**  
 Average salaries are consistent across job categories, ranging from approximately **Rs.74,760** in Education to **Rs.75,279** in Engineering & Technology. This small variation suggests a balanced compensation structure.
5. **Employee Status by Department**  
 The company has **33,372 active employees** and **16,628 terminated employees**. The Finance department has the highest number of terminations with **3,396 employees**, followed closely by IT with **3,374**.
6. **Performance Rating Distribution**  
 The distribution is unusually flat, with an almost equal number of employees at each performance rating level. For example, there are **10,116 employees** with a Rating of 1, and **9,985** with a Rating of 5. This could indicate that the performance review process is not effectively differentiating employee performance.
